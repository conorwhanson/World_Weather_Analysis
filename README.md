# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to create a vacation itinerary based on a vacationer-specified temperature range. First, a large set of latitudes and longitudes were randomly generated and from this cities are selected that fit the desired temperature range. Second, nearby hotels were added to the dataframe based on the city's geocoordinates. Third, from the cities that fit the desired temperature range 4 are selected and a travel itinerary is plotted on a map for the vacationer(s). Finally, the hotel information is added to the itinerary map markers.
